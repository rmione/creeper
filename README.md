# creeper
### _A handy Minecraft-related Discord bot!_

This very simple Discord bot will tell you through your Discord server the status of your Minecraft server, and more! 

## Commands 
__These commands are available to every user by default__
```bash
.creeper where server
```
This command will have the bot send a message that lets you know how many people are on the server as well as it's latency/ping.
```bash
.wake
```
The wake command wakes the server up if it's shut off, so __anybody__ can play, at __any__ time. 

```bash
.creeper help
```
The help command somewhat obviously sends to the user through DMs the list of commands and what they do. 

```bash
.creeper map
```
The map command will send the URL for the server's minimap plugin.
